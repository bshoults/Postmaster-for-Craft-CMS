### Postmaster

### Support

During the initial beta support may be limited, but will still be provided. For the benefit of others, if you have an bug, feature request, or question about implementation be sure to use the issues here in Github. If private support is required, you may email [support@objectivehtml.com](mailto:support@objectivehtml.com).

### Beta Status

Postmaster is launching with a free public beta. The official license is in the repository, but in short Postmaster is a commercial plugin that is currently available for free here on Github for the duration of the beta. You have permission to use Postmaster for any project for free during the beta. Once Postmaster is available for purchase, the free download will no longer be available and users that want support or updates must purchase a license.

### Roadmap

This software is still in active development with lots of features still to be added. If a feature is missing that you would like to see incorporated into the core, please send us an email to [support@objectivehtml.com](mailto:support@objectivehtml.com) or make an issue here in the repo.
